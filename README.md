Done as part of IOT course at Stockholm University
IOT Weather data Monitoring Python GUI for
Real-Time and Historical Data Visualization
Designed and implemented an IoT system to collect real-time environmental data including temperature, humidity, and pressure using sensor-enabled hardware.
Developed a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize live and historical weather data for user-friendly monitoring and analysis!

Enabled reliable data acquisition and transmission from IoT sensors to the application layer, supporting continuous data logging
Applied data processing and visualization techniques to present sensor readings clearly and support basic trend analysis.
